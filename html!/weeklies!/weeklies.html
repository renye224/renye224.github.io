<p>Arakawa, along with his wife Madeline Gins also published a book called “The Mechanism of Meaning”, which meant to present a series of essays and photographs which explore the abstract meaning behind binary forms of representing them. “The Mechanism of Meaning” displays self-contradictory puzzles presented in diagrammatic format, which juxtaposes how the medium is usually presented as. The relationship between diagrams and meaning isn’t one that is usually put into question, since diagrams are routinely used without meaning attached. They are often associated with technology and science fields, to display factual evidence, and are completely stripped of it’s meaning or feeling to maintain it’s trustworthiness. Arakawa challenges that with the series in “The Mechanism of Meaning”, and in his later work in his exhibits.
Arakawa’s first exhibit in New York, titled “Arakawa: Diagrams” explored the relationship between diagrams, and the meanings they are subsequently supposed to be devoid of. With his work, Arakawa interviews different, seemingly comical, mundane sources (such as it is in “Ambiguous zones of a lemon”), but in reality, show the nonsense and chaos of the mind thinking in relation, and challenge how we experience reality objectively. When thinking about diagrams,  we usually perceive them as objective truth, usually clean and devoid of meaning: only containing factual statements that are connected by lines showing relation. Arakawa challenges this notion by calling the viewer to find meaning within his seemingly trivial, comical diagrams. As French philosopher Jean-Francois Lyotard describes it, Arakawa's work “makes us think through the eyes.” He challenges the viewer to think outside of what a diagram is usually designed to do, and by making the webs so interconnected, also provides insight into how the mind is functioning while viewing a piece that is supposed to make sense.

<p>Hito Steyerl in the chapter “In Defense of the Poor Image” of the book The Wretched of the Screen explains the “poor image,” or the low resolution rendition of what once existed at a much richer quality. From his writing, we can glean that Steyerl sees that poor images essentially represent the easy spread of the digital image, specifically at a lower, “poorer” resolution, “images that can be made and seen by many” (Steyerl 41). By pirating or ripping media, either visual or aural, from its original source and recoding it, one creates a poor image that allows a larger audience to experience the bootlegged piece. In my opinion, though this may be a bit of a stretch, another good example of this concept is the knock-off merchandise sold outside of concert venues. Though this doesn’t necessarily have to do with motion-picture art, in a way this is a poor image of an artists design and branding on official merchandise that has been reproduced at lower quality with lower skill to be purchased for less money by a willing crowd. In this sense, the low res image has become a commodity in that it is cheaply processed and distributed at mass volume. An example of the poor image at work in the cultural sphere lies in the notion of bootlegging. </p>

  WEEKLY 5

<p>The poor quality of a reproduced piece of marginalized media, is often the result of its marginalization (or “appropriation and displacement”)
Image degradation is also the evidence of many people who cared enough about the image to circulate it (compress, decompress, re-edit, reupload…)
Poor images circulate in the void left by modern state film organizations
Culture production is a task of the state → culture is privatized
Led to a decline of avant-garde & non-commercial cinema
Piracy
New media & easy access to film tech would make cinema an art of the people
Users have active participation in image distribution. They are “drafted into production”
Users participate simultaneously in transgression & submission
Compression
Lose “matter” (data) and gain “speed” (are distributed)
Resists the fetish value of high resolution
Perfectly adapted to an information capitalism that values impression over immersion
Gains a new aura based on its transience
The circulation of poor images creates “visual bonds” between people
The poor image is no longer about its subject, it’s about itself! It’s about the new state of images after they’ve been liberated from protectionist national culture / commercial circulation. They are about reality!
